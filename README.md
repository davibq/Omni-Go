# Omni Go!

I go to the same 10 websites probably like 15 times per hour. But, let's say you go to AWS Console. Sometimes you need to go to Lambdas, sometimes to S3, sometimes to API Gateway. IMO bookmarks are not enough. Why not to try something else?

Omni Go! is a Chrome extension that allows you to configure your top sites and create shortcuts using Chrome's Omnibox.

Install the extension, open the adress bar, hit go and start getting faster to your preferred websites.
